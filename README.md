# OCB Core Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

This Core Mod is only meant as a POC and WIP project to kick-start
a community discussion to adapt something similar, or to build up on.
It should not be used in any project yet, since anything my change.

of all other mods to be loaded. Goal is to do this transparently as
possible, so no other mod needs to hard-depend on it if possible.
